A special thanks to the author. Excellent work. :)

#### some notes, snippets, and cool things:

##### grep -E "class|def"

In chapter 6 the author uses ```$ grep -E "class|def" lists/tests.py```.  This snippet outputs the equivalent of a printy print of classes and their functions. What an amazing little trick.  Also, awesomely this works for Ruby source files as well. Additionally, using sublime text file search (with regex on and with 'show context' off)  class|def  looks very similar to the terminal output (thanks, [Rick Carlino](https://github.com/rickcarlino) for the extras).
