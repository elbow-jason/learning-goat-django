====================

A special thanks to the author. Excellent work. :)

#### some notes, snippets, and cool things:

##### grep -E "class|def"

In chapter 6 the author uses ```$ grep -E "class|def" lists/tests.py```.  This snippet outputs the equivalent of a printy print of classes and functions. What an amazing little trick.
